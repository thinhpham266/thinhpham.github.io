	<h1>Contract</h1>
</header>

<main>

<p>I, Thinh Pham agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2019 WEB 115-85 Web Markup and Scripting class with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>

<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>

<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>

<p>Signed: Thinh Pham, January 13, 2019</p>
