	<p>
		I, Thinh Pham agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Sring, 2020, 85, 110, WEB with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.
	</p>
	<p>
	I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
	</p>
	<p>
	I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
